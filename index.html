                    <p>Our stagers will present your home to appeal to the widest range of buyers. We will maximize space, blend colors seemlessly, and make even the most difficult floor plans feel sensable. The potential buyer's attention will be drawn to the positive features of a property while at the same time their eyes are drawn away from any possible negative drawbacks the property may have. The goal of the staging is for the potential buyer to be excited about the property, to have a heart connection to the home so that they feel like it's already theirs and like they could move in right then and there. Our professional expertise is invaluable to our clients as it reduces the risk of price reduction and gives greater opportunity for the property to sell faster and for more.</p>

Staging Works! A Staged Home sells faster and for more money because it is more appealing to buyers. We have transformed many houses that sat on the market for months with no offers. After being staged by Limelight Home Staging, these properties have gone into escrow within a month and often for more than the asking price. In addition to highlighting positive features of the property and minimizing negative features, Staging helps potential buyers envision themselves in a home and mentally move-in. If a buyer cannot mentally move into a home, they move on instead!

Realtors should always educate their sellers about the benefits of Home Staging! Limelight Home Staging is a third party expert who is there to help you get your listing in top condition!
<ul>
<li>"Studies show that a home can sell up to <u>three times faster</u> when it is Staged." - San Francisco Chronicle</li>
<li>"Staging speeds up sales in a sluggish market, and can bump up prices 2 percent to 10 percent in a moderate market." - Wall Street Journal</li>
<li>"When Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Los Altos, Calif., looked at nearly 2,800 properties in eight U.S. cities in 2004, they found that the staged homes, on average, sold in half the time that the non-staged homes did. The sellers with staged homes ended up with 6.3% more than their asking price, on average, while sellers with non-staged homes sold for 1.6% more than the asking price." - USA Today</li>

I interviewed several stagers prior to selecting Sarah at Limelight Home Staging. She seemed to be the most knowledgeable and thorough. Sarah met and exceeded my expectations. We sold our home for $100,000 over asking price and I know it was due  to her staging. Sarah and her company are professional, detail oriented, and reliable. She completed the job on time and picked up the items several days after I requested. I could not be happier with her professionalism and the outcome her staging produced.

I have been working with Sarah at Limelight Home Staging for several years now. Sarah the ultimate professional! Her artistic design and sense of color makes each home look like it is right out of Architectural Digest Magazine. Sarah knows how to make an upper end home look like an estate, and a beach cottage like a vacation retreat. Her inventory of furniture is extensive which allows her to be sure you have different decor for different styles of homes. Sarah is always on schedule and on time, and she cleans up so well; you would never know she was there. I enjoy working with Sarah and I highly recommend her.<br/>

Our realtors (Stephen and Susan Karon) recommended Limelight.  After searching the Internet for alternative providers, we agreed that Limelight looked completely competent. Then we learned more...they were far more than competent.  Their prices and terms were very reasonable.  The look they imparted to our house impressed us completely.  What an eye they have!
Our house garnered two offers on the day of the open house.  I have no doubt that Limelight's efforts not only made this happen, but also added to the size of the offers we received to the tune of ten to fifteen times their fee.  What an incredible return on a simple investment.<br/>

Thank you Limelight!<br/>

 I am a Realtor and therefore very particular about who I use for my vendors. When it came time to sell my own home, I chose Sarah and her crew at Limelight. They were professional from top to bottom and really delivered exactly what they had promised.  She has a great eye for what works to sell a home. I particularly appreciated the way she treats her employees and that she is licensed  and bonded. I felt that I would be in good hands through the whole process and I was more than right.

Dear Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
It was mid July when I called Lauren Spencer to see about selling my home ASAP!  On August 3rd I moved into Valley Heights Residential, by September 3rd a firm buyer was found for my home and today I received the check finalizing its sale.  Of course selling a home was new to me. I had lived in my home for over 35 years.  I was a advised to patch it up here and there and  once my furnishings were removed I was advised by Lauren to have it "staged".  I had never heard of such a thing, but Lauren was persuasive.  I have to say that once I saw the professional photos on the MLS on line listings --I was really amazed at what Limelight Home Staging did to make my home a dream home.  My little home looked like something out of Better Homes and Gardens, and once staged it took less than one week to find the couple who ultimately purchased it.  It was done tastefully and conservatively, really showing off the best features of my 65 year old home.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot thank you enough for your professionalism, and the tasteful touches you added to my home to help make it marketable.<br/>
<br/>
Gratefully,<br/>

My sellers chose Sarah Meads Staging Services after attending a full years worth of open houses and seeing her work throughout Santa Cruz County. Sarah was both efficient and accommodating. The actual staging was done in a very short amount of time and she was able to work around our marketing timeline.  Limelight Home Staging went above and beyond. The finished product was a beautiful home that sold in days, with multiple offers, and for above list price. Staging was such an important part of our marketing. We would recommend Sarah's services again.<br/>

First the decision to spend money on staging was important. Although currently inventory is low and the market is picking up, high end properties will lag in the recovery especially in Santa Cruz County. I decided to hire a professional stager to set my property apart by accenting the strengths and minimizing the weaknesses. My goal was to sell quickly and get near the asking price. My agent and I interviewed several Home Stagers and selected Limelight Home Staging. The reason we selected Limelight is because Sarah was very confident with her abilities, her business acumen and she understood my goals. Sarah clearly understood the top selling points of the property and what type of buyer would likely be interested. She developed a plan, made some slight adjustments based on my inputs and seamlessly executed. The result is that the house sold within a couple of weeks of listing and at full asking price. Although many factors led to success, I believe the staging was a significant one. I would highly recommend Limelight Home Staging.<br/>

Sarah showed us examples from her portfolio, and we knew we had found our fit. She worked overtime to ensure that the property was ready for the open house. My clients and I were ecstatic with the final outcome and the home came out beautifully. We received multiple offers in the first three days and sold the house in under a week...at above our asking price! There is no doubt that the staging of the property assisted in the quick sale and ultimate higher sales price. I would highly recommend Sarah for all your staging needs and look forward to working with her again.<br/>

Limelight Staging did an exceptional job staging my property in Monterey. Prior to having it staged, the house was on the market for six months with no offers. I hired Limelight Staging to help get my house sold. Sarah, the owner of Limelight Home Staging, was professional from beginning to end. She presented an estimate, a written professional proposal and the price was very reasonable. She staged the property beyond beautifully. The staging exceeded my expectations. It was elegant when completed. Working with Sarah was easy, smooth and very professional. Soon after staging, the property received and offer and we sold fast!<br/>

I became the trustee for my uncle's estate and responsible for selling two small homes in Monterey. I selected Limelight Home Staging to stage the properties for two key reasons, they offered the quality I sought at affordable prices. The first house was on the market for just under one week and I received four offers. My agent reported receiving extremely positive comments from prospective buyers concerning the staging during the open house. Within one week the house was in escrow.<br/>
The second house never reached the market because my back-up buyer from the first house previewed the second house just after it was staged and made an offer on it that day. I firmly believe that the staging sold the homes since staging made the rooms in both homes appear larger than if they were unfurnished. The staging also made the properties look more inviting.<br/>
I'm very pleased with the quick sale of both houses. I certainly selected the right company for my staging needs. I highly recommend Limelight Home Staging for your next staging project.<br/>

Sarah, I just have to sincerely thank you for being the artist that you are! I got so many ecstatic comments from family and friends when I showed them the house. They, as I, absolutely loved what you did. I'll say it again, you are an artist and I am SO thankful that Mary recommended you to me. If a perspective client ever needs a little "convincing", put him in touch with me!<br/>
<br/>
I just have to thank you again for staging my mother's house.  It indeed showed well and sold quickly.  I must be honest.  I really didn't think I needed to stage the house in light of all the modernization improvements that we did.  I thought that it looked just fine!  Than a reoccurring theme kept coming in from my friends in the know: "Get the house staged!"  The real clincher was when my Realtor, Mary Aguilar, told me that staging the house was an investment well worth it and that Limelight Home Staging were the people to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I called you to come out and look at the house, still a bit skeptical even though I had the utmost confidence in Mary's professional advice.  You actually "studied" the house and made some suggestions like not having to stage all the bedrooms just the master bedroom.  The more I talked to you, the more confident I felt and decided, "I'll do it."<br/>
<br/>
When I saw the results, I was blown away!  I realized that as beautiful as the empty house was, it was only a blank canvas.  You, with your wonderful talent, transformed it into a work of art!  Furniture, wall hangings, table settings, bathrooms presentations, outside furniture, etc. were all placed in such a artistic way that the house was exquisitely transformed.  I was so amused (and wonderfully pleased) when family members came in to see the house who had been there numerous times before the staging.  They just marveled and their jaws dropped.  So, on behalf of the family and myself, thank you so much for all you did for us.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

I chose Limelight Home Staging after seeing a staged home that was done in a coastal theme last year. I was impressed that it was not over- decorated like some staged listings.  I also received a referral from another stager" recommending Limelight.</br>
When I walked thru the home prior to listing, it was vacant.  With the furniture moved out, the need for paint touch up and other miscellaneous imperfections became apparent.  I also noticed that the warmth that the home had while occupied was not there.</br>
Once Limelight came thru and did their magic, the house became a home.  Everyone who came thru exclaimed, "I could live here!"</br>
Thanks to Sarah and her team, we received 3 offers within 12 days and closed for over asking within 30 days.  I was very impressed with Sarah's professionalism and organizational skills, as well as her decorating skills.  I would recommend Limelight to anyone who wants to use a stager.</br>

Living in Seattle and listing a condo for sale in Santa Cruz is difficult, if not impossible! Three states away, I needed someone to handle my property, prepare it for sale, and trust that the job would be professional, and beautiful. Sarah Meads, owner of Limelight Home Staging was the perfect solution! She visited the property, prepared a thorough plan to stage the entire property, including the deck, and emailed me a proposal. The entire process was seamless and we happily chose her company. The presentation was elegant, provided a lovely set of photos for the internet, and impressed all who toured the property. Within a day, we had 2 offers and sold at an above asking price. My realtor was so impressed, she invited many colleagues to tour the property. I give Limelight the highest possible recommendation for home staging. If you want an exceptional, professional and beautiful space to show potential buyers, use Limelight Home Staging.<br/>

Dear Sarah:<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to drop you a note to tell you how very much we appreciated your professional staging service on our recent project. We are delighted to tell you that the property sold in just 11 days for full asking price! I have no doubt that your artful staging did the trick.<br/>
<br/>
During the showings we received numerous compliments on the look and feel of the home. I interviewed three different staging companies and found your quick response, professional yet personal presentation to be the best. After meeting with you, I checked out your website which answered any additional questions. You worked with me on a timeline that was amenable to me and the real estate agent. <br/>
<br/>
On the agreed upon day to stage, you and your team arrived within the given window and proceeded quickly to transform an empty dated space into an updated inviting home. The following day you returned as promised and completed important details like coordinated towels, linens, and attractive decorative items. I had several hours during the open houses to enjoy the end result. <br/>
<br/>
Once the property went into escrow, I contacted Limelight Home Staging to arrange “destaging”. Once again, the timing for that was coordinated for our convenience.<br/>
<br/>
I will utilize Limelight Home Staging again without hesitation. If you have future clients that need a personal recommendation, do not hesitate to give them my contact information. As a business owner for over 15 years, I respect and appreciate your level of customer service. Sadly, these days amazing service is rare.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again, Sarah. You are the best!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

Sarah Meads with Limelight Home Staging was very responsive to my request for a staging bid on my Los Gatos listing that I was preparing for market. When she went to the home to bid the job it was full of tradespeople getting it repaired and painted. Undaunted she measured the rooms and gave suggestions to stage and market the home effectively. She wasn't the least expensive bid received but you know the old axiom of "You get what you pay for", she was worth every penny! She was professional, accommodating and worked around a schedule that was tight at best. I am truly grateful for her efforts and I can honestly say that her staging really made the home come alive!<br/>

The staging looks great! Thank you for all your hard work. The fact that you had the "ASP" designation was a big plus for me in making the decision to use Limelight Home Staging to meet my clients staging needs. Your consultation was very helpful to all parties included. It helped us determine how we wanted to stage the house and what type of look we wanted to achieve. In the end, I knew your work had been successful for two reasons: One, the house sold within 3 days of being listed and two, the buyers were very interested in all the furniture that you had used to achieve the look.<br/>
Thanks again for all your help.<br/>
