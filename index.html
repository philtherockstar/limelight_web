                    <ul>
                        <li> Home Staging yields a fantastic return when a house is priced within current market value!</li>
                        <li> In addition to the <a href="#testimonials" >many success stories</a> we've received from our customers, these national studies found:
                            <ul>
                                <li> Staged homes sell for more than non-staged homes (up to 17% more) according to U.S. Housing and Urban Development.</li>
                                <li>Staged homes sell faster than non-staged homes (43% faster) according to the Association of Property Scene Designers.</li>
                             </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Unlike a home that sits on the market, a Staged home sells faster, saving the owner money by not needing to pay property expenses month after month:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Thousands in Mortgages</li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>With the combination of selling higher than non-staged homes, selling faster than non-staged homes, and greatly reducing the chance of a price reduction, Staging literally pays for itself many times over!</b></li>

The designers at Limelight Home Staging are experts at transforming difficult spaces into functional and sensible spaces. Once Limelight stages your house, buyers won't be wondering how they can use a space, they will see it with their own eyes!</p><p>The property pictured above was built as a hexagon centered around a fireplace. Before staging, buyers would have a difficult time envisioning how they could live in this unusual property design. After Limelight staged it, the guesswork was over. As soon as they opened the front door, everything made perfect sense!

When buyers walk through an empty space, they often have a hard time envisioning how they could live in it. This experience distances them further from your property <b>and from your asking price</b>. Limelight Home Staging can transform your vacant property into a stunning, vibrant and alluring environment for buyers. This often can result in competing offers, helping to drive up the price.</p>

                        <p>
If the home is not vacant, we can help you with a staging consultation. A consultation begins with an overall evaluation of your home and its staging needs. One of our designers will walk through your home room by room and describe in detail what needs to take place to show your home at its best. If necessary, we will provide you with an outline of what it would require for Limelight to implement your staging needs. Once you receive the outline, you can then decide on how much – or how little – Limelight Home Staging can support you in implementing the suggested changes.

<p><b>One Day Makeovers</b></p><p>
Limelight Home Staging can transform your home using your own furnishings! Design and shopping services are available as well if you would like to change or supplement your existing décor.</p><br/>

<p>We use our expertise to recreate your home.  By remixing your furniture and accessories, we can make your home feel new again. <!-- In the March 2006 issue of Real Simple Magazine, in an article entitled, “Fix Your Money Leaks” the author suggests an alternative to pricey renovations. He states, “A wiser option is hiring a professional who can give your home an inexpensive makeover. ‘A home stager adds furnishings, decorative touches, and details.’” By adding a few select pieces to “round out” your existing furnishings, we will dramatically reenergize your home for a fraction of the cost usually associated with redecorating! --></p>

The condo that I sold was relatively small at only 1000 ft.² for two bedrooms. I knew from having lived in small places before that how you arrange furniture and decorate can have a big difference on how welcoming and useful a space feels.   I had never had a place staged before I sold it before, so honestly I was a little bit surprised at the cost of staging. However, I went forward knowing that even a small difference on the overall sales price could easily pay for the staging. What I wasn't prepared for was how fantastic the staging made the place look! I was absolutely stunned when I saw the pictures on the listing with everything properly staged. In the end our place ended up selling for $41,000 more than our asking price of $459,000. Even if I only attribute half of that increase to the staging it's still a great deal. Where else can you get a more than 10x return on your investment?

I highly recommend Limelight Home Staging to anyone selling their home.  Sarah Meads is a true professional with lots of experience and a talent for a home appear at it’s best. She did a fantastic job for us. We felt that her work increased the price we could ask for our house by many thousands of dollars. Limelight Home Staging played a key role in our decision because the house looked so good after they staged it. Our house was quite old and had an unusual layout. Two prior attempts at staging the house were totally unsuccessful. Fortunately we found Sarah and Limelight Home Staging. With a very short timeframe before the house went on the open market, Sarah stepped in and worked her magic. She and her team made the house much more attractive while demonstrating to buyers how to use the rooms most effectively. Buyers seemed to agree, because we received $121,000 over our asking price, much more than anyone had expected. We would hire Limelight again in a heartbeat. Sarah is very pleasant to work with. She communicated well with us, answering calls quickly, giving us regular updates via email and making numerous accommodations. Also, everyone on her team was courteous and it was obvious that they enjoyed their working environment. I whole-heartedly recommend Sarah and Limelight Home Staging.

I have been working with Sarah at Limelight Home Staging for several years now. Sarah the ultimate professional! Her artistic design and sense of color makes each home look like it is right out of Architectural Digest Magazine. Sarah knows how to make an upper end home look like an estate, and a beach cottage like a vacation retreat. Her inventory of furniture is extensive which allows her to be sure you have different decor for different styles of homes. Sarah is always on schedule and on time, and she cleans up so well; you would never know she was there. I enjoy working with Sarah and I highly recommend her.<br/>

Sarah Meads, with Limelight Home Staging is hands down, the best stager on the Monterey Peninsula!  I have worked with her now on staging 3 different homes, and I am convinced that her staging made the difference in getting each one sold quickly at top dollar.  Her professionalism and attention to detail was so much appreciated, and  it was evident that she really loves her work!    Every home that she staged was stunning and she was a pleasure to work with!  I highly recommend her services and I will definitely be using Sarah again!<br/>

Our realtors (Stephen and Susan Karon) recommended Limelight.  After searching the Internet for alternative providers, we agreed that Limelight looked completely competent. Then we learned more...they were far more than competent.  Their prices and terms were very reasonable.  The look they imparted to our house impressed us completely.  What an eye they have!
Our house garnered two offers on the day of the open house.  I have no doubt that Limelight's efforts not only made this happen, but also added to the size of the offers we received to the tune of ten to fifteen times their fee.  What an incredible return on a simple investment.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Limelight!<br/>

Hi Sarah,<br/>
 I am a Realtor and therefore very particular about who I use for my vendors. When it came time to sell my own home, I chose Sarah and her crew at Limelight. They were professional from top to bottom and really delivered exactly what they had promised.  She has a great eye for what works to sell a home. I particularly appreciated the way she treats her employees and that she is licensed  and bonded. I felt that I would be in good hands through the whole process and I was more than right.  Thanks Sarah. <br/>

Dear Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
It was mid July when I called Lauren Spencer to see about selling my home ASAP!  On August 3rd I moved into Valley Heights Residential, by September 3rd a firm buyer was found for my home and today I received the check finalizing its sale.  Of course selling a home was new to me. I had lived in my home for over 35 years.  I was a advised to patch it up here and there and  once my furnishings were removed I was advised by Lauren to have it "staged".  I had never heard of such a thing, but Lauren was persuasive.  I have to say that once I saw the professional photos on the MLS on line listings --I was really amazed at what Limelight Home Staging did to make my home a dream home.  My little home looked like something out of Better Homes and Gardens, and once staged it took less than one week to find the couple who ultimately purchased it.  It was done tastefully and conservatively, really showing off the best features of my 65 year old home.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot thank you enough for your professionalism, and the tasteful touches you added to my home to help make it marketable.<br/>
<br/>
Gratefully,<br/>

My sellers chose Sarah Meads Staging Services after attending a full years worth of open houses and seeing her work throughout Santa Cruz County. Sarah was both efficient and accommodating. The actual staging was done in a very short amount of time and she was able to work around our marketing timeline.  Limelight Home Staging went above and beyond. The finished product was a beautiful home that sold in days, with multiple offers, and for above list price. Staging was such an important part of our marketing. We would recommend Sarah's services again.<br/>

First the decision to spend money on staging was important. Although currently inventory is low and the market is picking up, high end properties will lag in the recovery especially in Santa Cruz County. I decided to hire a professional stager to set my property apart by accenting the strengths and minimizing the weaknesses. My goal was to sell quickly and get near the asking price. My agent and I interviewed several Home Stagers and selected Limelight Home Staging. The reason we selected Limelight is because Sarah was very confident with her abilities, her business acumen and she understood my goals. Sarah clearly understood the top selling points of the property and what type of buyer would likely be interested. She developed a plan, made some slight adjustments based on my inputs and seamlessly executed. The result is that the house sold within a couple of weeks of listing and at full asking price. Although many factors led to success, I believe the staging was a significant one. I would highly recommend Limelight Home Staging.<br/><br/>

Sarah showed us examples from her portfolio, and we knew we had found our fit. She worked overtime to ensure that the property was ready for the open house. My clients and I were ecstatic with the final outcome and the home came out beautifully. We received multiple offers in the first three days and sold the house in under a week...at above our asking price! There is no doubt that the staging of the property assisted in the quick sale and ultimate higher sales price. I would highly recommend Sarah for all your staging needs and look forward to working with her again.<br/><br/>

Limelight Staging did an exceptional job staging my property in Monterey. Prior to having it staged, the house was on the market for six months with no offers. I hired Limelight Staging to help get my house sold. Sarah, the owner of Limelight Home Staging, was professional from beginning to end. She presented an estimate, a written professional proposal and the price was very reasonable. She staged the property beyond beautifully. The staging exceeded my expectations. It was elegant when completed. Working with Sarah was easy, smooth and very professional. Soon after staging, the property received and offer and we sold fast!<br/>
